    <h3>What is a Media Query? </h3>
    <p> Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. </p>

    <p> It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. </p>

    <p>Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as
        print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport
        width).</p>

    <h3>Core concepts </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. Use them to control when your layout can be
            adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
        </li>
        <li>

            Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to
            conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use
            min-width in our media queries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to
            make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger
            devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your
            visitors.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Min-width</h3>
    <p> Bootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our
        layout, grid system, and components.</p>

    <p>These Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:

        Copy </p>
    <ul>

        <li>
            <p> X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px) </p>
            <p> No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)</p>
            <p> @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)</p>
            <p> @media (min-width: 768px) { ... } </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)</p>
            <p> @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)</p>
            <p> @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)</p>
            <p> @media (min-width: 1400px) { ... } </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
